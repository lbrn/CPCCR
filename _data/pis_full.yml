  project_title: Strategic inhibition of EGFR-family signaling using novel peptidomimetic inhibitors of HER2 for the treatment of osteosarcoma.
  pcec_use: |
    HER2 drug inhibitor assays will be performed against 3D OSA spheroids using the Cytation5 instrument and 3D OSA spheroids bioprinting will be performed. A kinase inhibitor library will be screened to identify new inhibitors of the OSA spheroids either alone and in combination with the HER inhibitors. In vivo OSA models will be used to test efficacy of inhibitors against OSA and will be analyzed (toxicity, PK).
  mbipc_use: |
    RNA-seq will be performed on compound 18/Hyp-18 treated OSA cell lines to explore for compensatory pathway upregulation. Single-cell RNA sequencing will be conducted to uncover microenvironment-mediated resistance mechanisms in OSA spheroids and tumors from mouse OSA models.
  abstract: |
    Dr. Witherâ€™s research proposal aims to develop novel therapeutic strategies that overcome current therapeutic limitations in order to fulfill the potential of EGFR-targeting strategies to improve outcome in osteosarcoma (OSA. Her central hypothesis is that strategic inhibition of EGFR-family signaling will provide an additional tool for treating metastatic OSA. In order to develop rational therapeutic strategies for optimally inhibiting EGFR-family mediated OSA progression, Dr. Withers proposes utilizing novel peptidomimetic HER2 heterodimerization inhibitors of EGFR:HER2 and HER2:HER3, a TKI library, in vitro high-throughput screening, RNA-seq, and 3D bioprinting, to identify promising agents and combinations. Selected candidates will be tested in vivo in both experimental and naturally-occurring canine models of OSA.

  project_title: Evaluation of Subtype Specific Collagen Remodeling in Breast Cancer Progression.
  pcec_use: |
    Tumor cell dormancy will be measured by In vitro proliferation and drug resistance of 3D bioprinted breast cancer spheroids using the Cytation5 instrument. Spheroids will be generated comprised of different collagen matrix and spheroid size will be monitored by high content imaging. Evaluation of drug resistance in collagen bioprinted spheroids (I, V, IV, XII, fibronectin, and synthetic collagens) will be measured by using the NIH oncology drug panel in screening assays. Human stromal cell lines overexpressing the different collagens using CRISPR/dcas9 will be generated.

    My diverse training in engineering, breast cancer, and regenerative medicine has led to my current work: investigating subtype specific breast cancer progression and remodeling of the tumor microenvironment. I strongly feel that my prior work in three different developmental/regenerative medicine based labs combined with my graduate and post-doctoral studies in breast cancer and my current position as faculty in Biological Engineering provides an innovative perspective in the study of breast cancer biology. I plan to integrate these disciplines to establish a connection between tumor architecture, stromal remodeling, and progression to a drug resistant breast cancer phenotype. While training in regenerative medicine I acquired skills on tissue decellularization and proteomic analysis of tissue matrix. I used these techniques to identify novel mechanism to evaluate tumor structure, through the development of a tumor decellularization model. Encompassed within this is evaluating how the tumor microenvironment may facilitate cell dormancy and a cancer stem phenotype. Currently I am using the skills acquired in engineering to develop physiologically relevant tumor models that more accurately mimic specific patient populations.  I believe that I am uniquely positioned to develop these ideas as I have had extensive training in the fields of cancer, regenerative medicine, and engineering. The project proposed here will provide a paradigm shift from treating breast cancer cells to the evaluation and treatment of the surrounding stroma.

   Currently there are no available therapies designed to appropriately target the triple negative/basal breast cancer subtype (TNBC). Due to the risk of recurrence and metastasis following primary therapy, novel avenues of intervention must be pursued. The tumor matrix, the material cancer cells are grown on, modulates cellular proliferation and survival, however a link between a TNBC subtype specific extracellular matrix (ECM) and mechanisms of TNBC drug resistance has not yet been made. This proposal will identify novel mechanism of matrix induced drug resistance in TNBC. Using a combination of 3D in vitro screens, murine models of TNBC, and primary patient samples, Dr. Martin will interrogate novel matrix proteins (collagen IV, XII, and fibronectin) involved in TNBC drug resistance. The hypothesis of this proposals is: TNBC extracellular matrix enhances drug resistance through the induction of cellular dormancy. Dr. Martin will use in vitro 3D tumor models to screen the effects of matrix composition on induction of cellular dormancy and a cancer stem cell phenotype in TNBC. Furthermore Dr. Martin will determine how cancer cells grown on different matrix composites alter immune cell activation and proliferation, providing new insight on matrix induced immune evasion. These in vitro screens will be validated in vivo through the construction and evaluation of conditional knock out of matrix proteins (collagen IV, XII, fibronectin) in the mammary fat pad of transgenic murine models. Finally the clinical significant of this study will be verified through the interrogation and histological evaluation of matrix composition, immune infiltration, and occurrence of cell dormancy in a panel TNBC primary tumors. Dr. Martin will use proteomics to evaluate the matrix composition of primary TNBC and adjacent matched tissue and correlate these finding with observed immune infiltration. Additional histological evaluation and confirmation will also be performed. This will be investigated through the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1. Evaluate the effect of ECM composition on TNBC drug resistance. Specific Aim 2. Determine the translational relevance of subtype specific ECM composition.

  project_title: Phosphoglycerate mutase 5 (PGAM5) in the regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism and carcinogenesis.
  pcec_use: |
    Development of steatosis will be measured in a 2D monoculture model of NAFLD  using wild-type (WT) and Pgam5-/- primary murine hepatocytes, human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2), and rat hepatic hybrid cells (WIF-B). To model the complex mitochondrial metabolic phenotype of NAFLD associated HCC, 3D single and mixed cell spheroid models will be bioprinted using WT and Pgam5-/- HepG2 cells with and without immortalized WT human hepatic stellate cells (LX-2). High content imaging and proliferation assays using the Cytation5 instrument will monitor spheroid development.
  mbipc_use: |
    Single cell sequencing of steatotic and non-steatotic, WT and PGAM5-/- HepG2 cells will be performed to evaluate targeted changes in lipid metabolism and unbiased transcriptome profiling. Spheroid mitochondrial respiration and glycolytic flux will be measured using the Seahorse XFe96 analyzer. Spheroid cellular ROS will be measured using fixed and live cell imaging of molecular oxidant sensing probes.

  abstract: |
   The broad objective of this project is to determine whether changesin mitochondrial metabolism mechanistically influence the transition fromnon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). NAFLD isemerging as a leading cause of HCC. HCC survival outcomes are poor. Defining the bioenergetic pathophysiology of NAFLD and its progression to HCC will identify new biomarkers and therapeutic targets. The mitochondrial membrane proteinphosphoglycerate mutase 5 (PGAM5) regulatesan array of mitochondrial homeostatic pathways. Recent research showsthat depletion of PGAM5 preventsboth high fat diet (HFD) induced obesity and the progression of HCC. The proposedresearch will test the hypothesisthat distinct mitochondrial metabolic pathways are responsible for these effects.A liver specificknockout mouse will be generatedtodetermine whetherhepatocyte specific loss of PGAM5 will inhibitsteatosis in a HFD model.Single cell RNA sequencing of a human HCC cell linewill determine if PGAM5 depletion alters gene expression associated with hepatic lipid metabolism. HCC spheroids will be used to characterize how loss of PGAM5 modulatesmitochondrial respiration and glycolysisin a steatosis model. Two specific aims are proposed: Aim 1 will determine whether PGAM5 knockout inhibits hepatocellular steatosis. Aim 2 will determine whether PGAM5 deletion alters mitochondrial metabolism in HCC leading to increased reactive oxygen speciesproduction.

    3D prostate cancer cells will be bioprinted and effects of DEB on tumor proliferation and cell signaling will be quantified using Cytation5 imaging and dye uptake assay. PI3K/akt/mTOR inhibitors will be evaluated in drug inhibition assays in the presence or absence of DEB.  Specific signaling inhibitors will be screened against 3D prostate cell spheroid proliferation alone or in combination with DEB and other inhibitors. Following RNAseq analysis of spheroid cells by MBIPC, knockout cells will be generated by CRISPR/Cas9 methods.
  mbipc_use: |
    Single-cell transcriptome (scRNAseq) and proteomic analyses on DEB-treated versus control spheroids will be conducted to identify the full range of genes/ proteins that are altered by DEB and that contribute to tumor progression. Single-cell transcriptome analyses are required for these studies because individual cells in spheroids may respond differently to DEB depending on their location within the spheroids. These analyses will allow him to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which DEB induces EMT in prostate cancer cells. Differentially expressed genes (showing two-fold change and above) will be selected and genes with known association with cell signaling pathways will be validated by qPCR. The MBIPC will assist Dr. Yi with Quantitative real time PCR analysis using the the Quantstudio 12 K flex.

    Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men with more than 1.2 million cases and 380,000 deaths world wide and 358,000 deaths annually and with more than 160,000 new cases per year in the United States (Siegel et al., 2019). Age, ethnicity, diet, gene mutations and a number of other factors are associated with increased risk for prostate cancer. However, the cellular processes that are responsible for generation of a cancer cell are not well known, although it is suspected that dysregulation of cellular apoptotic pathways may be directly or indirectly contributing to prostate cell generation. Our overall hypothesis is that widely distributed toxins such as Diepoxybutane (DEB), a carcinogenic metabolite of 1, 3-butadiene (BD), a hazardous chemical used in rubber production and present in automobile exhaust and tobacco smoke cause specific signaling cellular changes leading to prostate cancer. Our long-term goal is to investigate the molecular mechanism(s) of the DEB toxin-induced carcinogenesis utilizing 3D cell cultures aiming to identify the main cell signaling pathways activated and/or inhibited by DEB. Based on previous results, we propose to identify the molecular mechanism by which DEB activates specific cell signaling pathways contributing to tumor progression using our 3D cellular model of Diepoxybutane (DEB) treatment. Specifically, we hypothesize that DEB may be effective in inducing Epithelial-to- Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), and that it stimulates drug resistant mechanisms through the activation of specific cell signaling pathways. We will test our hypothesis by the following Aims. (1). To identify the functional role of the PI3K/AKT/ mTOR cell signaling pathway in prostate cancer progression. To accomplish this Aim, prostate cancer spheroids (3D cancer cultures) will be treated with DEB in the absence or presence of specific signal transduction inhibitors and the effect of DEB on cells under specific pathway inhibition conditions will be examined at the transcriptomic and proteomic levels. (2). To investigate the molecular mechanism by which DEB promotes prostate cancer progression. To compliment the above achievement, single cell RNA sequencing and proteomic analyses will be performed. The results obtained from this project will help us understand the role of DEB on prostate cancer progression and will provide an insight on mechanisms of chemotherapy resistance. Furthermore, the results obtained from this project will provide insights into new important approaches to combat prostate cancer, which may also be applicable to other types of cancer. More importantly, the knowledge acquired at the conclusion of this project may enhance our ability to combat cancer.
