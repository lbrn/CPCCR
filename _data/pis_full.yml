  project_title: Strategic inhibition of EGFR-family signaling using novel peptidomimetic inhibitors of HER2 for the treatment of osteosarcoma.
  pcec_use: HER2 drug inhibitor assays will be performed against 3D OSA spheroids using the Cytation5 instrument and 3D OSA spheroids bioprinting will be performed. A kinase inhibitor library will be screened to identify new inhibitors of the OSA spheroids either alone and in combination with the HER inhibitors. In vivo OSA models will be used to test efficacy of inhibitors against OSA and will be analyzed (toxicity, PK).
  mbipc_use: RNA-seq will be performed on compound 18/Hyp-18 treated OSA cell lines to explore for compensatory pathway upregulation. Single-cell RNA sequencing will be conducted to uncover microenvironment-mediated resistance mechanisms in OSA spheroids and tumors from mouse OSA models.

    Dr. Wither’s research proposal aims to develop novel therapeutic strategies that overcome current therapeutic limitations in order to fulfill the potential of EGFR-targeting strategies to improve outcome in osteosarcoma (OSA. Her central hypothesis is that strategic inhibition of EGFR-family signaling will provide an additional tool for treating metastatic OSA. In order to develop rational therapeutic strategies for optimally inhibiting EGFR-family mediated OSA progression, Dr. Withers proposes utilizing novel peptidomimetic HER2 heterodimerization inhibitors of EGFR:HER2 and HER2:HER3, a TKI library, in vitro high-throughput screening, RNA-seq, and 3D bioprinting, to identify promising agents and combinations. Selected candidates will be tested in vivo in both experimental and naturally-occurring canine models of OSA.

  project_title: Evaluation of Subtype Specific Collagen Remodeling in Breast Cancer Progression.
  pcec_use: Tumor cell dormancy will be measured by In vitro proliferation and drug resistance of 3D bioprinted breast cancer spheroids using the Cytation5 instrument. Spheroids will be generated comprised of different collagen matrix and spheroid size will be monitored by high content imaging. Evaluation of drug resistance in collagen bioprinted spheroids (I, V, IV, XII, fibronectin, and synthetic collagens) will be measured by using the NIH oncology drug panel in screening assays. Human stromal cell lines overexpressing the different collagens using CRISPR/dcas9 will be generated.
  mbipc_use: Histological evaluation of breast cancer slides for activation of signaling pathways and ECM composition will be performed by a board-certified pathologist. Flow cytometric analysis of immune cell infiltration of tumors in mouse model, single cell sorting, proteomics and mass spectrometry to identify protein levels will be performed. With coordination by the MBIPC, collagen transgenic mice will be generated by the LSU Pennington Biomedical Research Center (PBRC) Transgenic Mouse Core (supported by the La CaTs Translational Science Center).

    Dr. Martin’s research focuses on dissecting the underlying mechanisms of breast cancer heterogeneity and therapy resistance that is observed in breast cancer subtypes (luminal A, luminal B, HER2, and triple-negative-TNBC).  The different subtypes differ in tumor extracellular matrix (ECM) or collagen composition. In vitro models on matrix induced cancer progression and drug resistance have focused primarily on collagen I; however, Dr. Martin’s preliminary data shows that other collagens (X, XII, V) are expressed in triple-negative TNBC and collagen I is decreased.  Dr. Martin hypothesizes that collagen tumor progression and ECM composition promotes tumor progression and drug resistance. She will test this hypothesis by comparing drug resistance of 3D bioprinted breast cancer spheroids composed of different collagen proteins. Dr. Martin will also test whether tumor collagen composition influences tumor cell senescence or dormancy and contributes to drug resistance.

  project_title: Phosphoglycerate mutase 5 (PGAM5) in the regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism and carcinogenesis.
  pcec_use: Development of steatosis will be measured in a 2D monoculture model of NAFLD  using wild-type (WT) and Pgam5-/- primary murine hepatocytes, human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2), and rat hepatic hybrid cells (WIF-B). To model the complex mitochondrial metabolic phenotype of NAFLD associated HCC, 3D single and mixed cell spheroid models will be bioprinted using WT and Pgam5-/- HepG2 cells with and without immortalized WT human hepatic stellate cells (LX-2). High content imaging and proliferation assays using the Cytation5 instrument will monitor spheroid development.
  mbipc_use: Single cell sequencing of steatotic and non-steatotic, WT and PGAM5-/- HepG2 cells will be performed to evaluate targeted changes in lipid metabolism and unbiased transcriptome profiling. Spheroid mitochondrial respiration and glycolytic flux will be measured using the Seahorse XFe96 analyzer. Spheroid cellular ROS will be measured using fixed and live cell imaging of molecular oxidant sensing probes.

    Dr. Johnston investigates Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) associated Hepatic cell Carcinoma (HCC). NAFLD affects 30% of the world’s population and is a significant risk factor for progression to the inflammatory liver disease non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and HCC. With the growing obesity epidemic, NAFLD/NASH is rapidly becoming the leading cause of HCC. Evidence has emerged linking defects in mitochondrial metabolism to the transition from NAFLD to HCC. The mitochondrial membrane protein phosphoglycerate mutase 5 (PGAM5) stands out as a protein of interest in the complex transition from NAFLD to HCC. Dr. Johnston proposes to test the overarching hypothesis that PGAM5 knockout in hepatocytes inhibits hepatic steatosis and decreases tumorigenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma by modifying mitochondrial metabolism.  Dr. Johnston proposes the following specific aims.  Dr. Johnston will determine whether PGAM5 deletion alters mitochondrial metabolism in hepatocellular carcinoma leading to increased ROS production.

  project_title: Mechanism of cancer progression in prostate cancer cells.
  pcec_use: 3D prostate cancer cells will be bioprinted and effects of DEB on tumor proliferation and cell signaling will be quantified using Cytation5 imaging and dye uptake assay. PI3K/akt/mTOR inhibitors will be evaluated in drug inhibition assays in the presence or absence of DEB.  Specific signaling inhibitors will be screened against 3D prostate cell spheroid proliferation alone or in combination with DEB and other inhibitors. Following RNAseq analysis of spheroid cells by MBIPC, knockout cells will be generated by CRISPR/Cas9 methods.
  mbipc_use: Single-cell transcriptome (scRNAseq) and proteomic analyses on DEB-treated versus control spheroids will be conducted to identify the full range of genes/ proteins that are altered by DEB and that contribute to tumor progression. Single-cell transcriptome analyses are required for these studies because individual cells in spheroids may respond differently to DEB depending on their location within the spheroids. These analyses will allow him to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which DEB induces EMT in prostate cancer cells. Differentially expressed genes (showing two-fold change and above) will be selected and genes with known association with cell signaling pathways will be validated by qPCR. The MBIPC will assist Dr. Yi with Quantitative real time PCR analysis using the the Quantstudio 12 K flex.

    Dr. Yi’s research proposal seeks to shed light on the molecular mechanism(s) responsible for Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) using a 3D model that relies on the treatment of prostate cancer cells with the environmental toxin Diepoxybutane (DEB). DEB is a carcinogenic metabolite of 1,3-butadiene (BD), a hazardous chemical used in rubber production and present in automobile exhaust and tobacco smoke. DEB blocks the cell cycle and induces apoptosis upon binding to DNA. Dr. Yi has shown that at low concentrations (0.5 M), DEB resulted in DU145 cell migration and activation of PI3K/akt/mTOR signaling and EMT marker expression indicating that DEB may promote tumor progression by inducing EMT.  He hypothesizes that DEB may be effective in inducing EMT and stimulating drug resistant mechanisms through the activation of specific cell signaling pathways. Therefore, the use of DEB for the treatment of 3D cell cultures of prostate cancer cells may constitute a reliable model to study cancer progression in culture.
